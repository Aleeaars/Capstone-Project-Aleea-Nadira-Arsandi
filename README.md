# Capstone Project: Mental Health Analysis in the Tech Industry
# Project Overview
This project focuses on Mental Health in the Tech Industry. It appears to analyze data related to mental health, likely within the tech sector, to derive insights and provide actionable recommendations. The project utilizes Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and langchain_community with Replicate for AI model integration.

# Insights & Findings
The analysis suggests that employees under 35 tend to experience more mental health challenges compared to older ones. Although the dataset lacks details on remote work and treatment, age seems to play a role. Company support, like benefits and work environment, may also influence mental well-being, but more complete data is needed for stronger conclusions.

# AI support explanation
This project leverages AI to analyze mental health patterns in the tech industry using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal is to uncover potential relationships between age, gender, remote work, and company support with employees' mental well-being. With the help of IBM Granite's large language model (LLM), natural language prompts were used to generate insights, questions, and even conclusions directly from the data. This allows for more intuitive exploration and interpretation of complex datasets without requiring deep statistical coding.
